# Santa Game



## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

* A title. Replace the title at the beginning of this document.
Santa Game

* Summary or introduction. In general, in a few lines or less, what is your program about or what is it about?
My program is a Christmas themed graphics game. The user tries to drop presents on houses while avoiding the grinch. 

* How does the user access your program? Is it shared via https://runpython.org? Is a web site? Embedded in 
  a single board computer? 
  The user can paste the py link from this repository into runpython.org. 
  
* If there are graphics screens involved, describe every screen that the user will experience: what is it for? 
  What did the user have to do to get there and how does she move on to the next?
  There is one constantly moving screen (a Christmas background) with houses and grinchs at the bottom. The user doesn't have to move from one screen to the next, the program does it for them. 
  
* For each graphics screen, describe every active control input and what it does. What elements on the screen will
  change in response to user input?
  If the user clicks the screen a present will drop. 
  
* Does the program respond to mouse input? What, exactly, does the mouse do?
If the user clicks the screen, the present will drop. 

* Does the program respond to keyboard input? How?
If the user clicks the screen, the present will drop. 
* What graphical assets will be used?
I used TextAsset, ImageAsset and SoundAsset. 
* Does the user have to do anything to install the program?
No, just have access to runpython.org. 

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
* The name of any files or tools that you will use to design the program.
